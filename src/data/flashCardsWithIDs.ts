      "How do you efficiently manage WebSocket-based real-time updates in a large React/Next.js application that serves thousands of concurrent users?",
    answer:
      "One approach is to offload connection handling to a dedicated service or gateway (e.g., Socket.io on a separate cluster), then push updates to Next.js using serverless functions or server routes for SSR. Scale horizontally by running multiple WebSocket nodes with a pub/sub system like Redis or NATS, ensuring each node receives pertinent broadcast events.

    answer:
      "Use a container-based approach (Kubernetes Job or AWS Fargate) so each job runs in isolation. Pass job parameters via a queue (e.g., SQS, RabbitMQ). The Node.js orchestrator triggers ephemeral workers that retrieve the workload, run the CPU-intensive step, then store results. Once complete, the container shuts down, freeing resources. Enforce resource limits to prevent hogging cluster capacity. Monitor job metrics (duration, success/failure) for scaling decisions. This pattern avoids tying up the main microservice with heavy tasks.",

For integration tests, spin up dependencies (databases, queues) in Docker and run go test with real or mocked endpoints. Capture coverage via a coverage.out file aggregated by each test run. For E2E tests, use a separate framework (like k6 or Cypress if a REST interface is exposed) and monitor high-level behavior. Combine coverage reports if needed, or at least maintain separate coverage thresholds for unit and integration layers.",

      "Keep your desired Kubernetes configuration in a version-controlled repo. Automated pipelines (e.g., Argo CD or Flux) watch the repo for changes and apply them to the cluster. This ensures a single source of truth and allows rollbacks by reverting Git commits. Each microservice has its own folder or Helm chart. Tag releases with semantic versioning, and run integration tests and security scans before merges. Monitor the cluster state to confirm alignment with Git.",

    question:
      "How do you avoid hot partitions in a NoSQL database like DynamoDB under heavy write load?",
    answer:
      "Adopt a partition key that has high cardinality and evenly distributes writes. For example, include a random suffix or time-based shard in the primary key. If you have frequently accessed items with skewed distribution, implement a write-sharding strategy or consider a globally distributed system. Monitor throttled requests and use on-demand capacity if traffic patterns are unpredictable.",

        question: "Why is a composite key often recommended in DynamoDB?",
        answer:
          "It allows more granular item sorting within a partition and can distribute data more evenly by combining user ID or entity ID with time or another dimension.",

    answer:
      "There can be replication lag, meaning read replicas may serve stale data. For critical operations (e.g., checking stock before checkout), you might need to query the master or adopt a strategy to confirm data freshness. Transactions that span writes and immediate reads can cause inconsistencies if the replica hasn't caught up yet. Monitoring and fallback logic are needed to handle lag spikes.",

    answer:
      "Use a backend service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and APNs for iOS, bridging with a library that handles both. Abstract push token management in your server so you can unify notification sending. Ensure you handle iOS permission prompts gracefully, and handle background message processing differently on Android. For reliability, queue notifications if immediate delivery fails and re-attempt with exponential backoff.",

Cache the secrets in memory only if frequent reads are necessary and rotate them automatically with AWS's rotation feature.

    answer:
      "Partitioning is crucial—assign all events for a given account or transaction sequence to the same partition to preserve ordering. You must handle partition rebalances carefully, ensuring consumer groups reassign partitions without missing or duplicating messages. Also, confirm you have proper replication factors and acknowledgment settings to avoid data loss, since transaction logs must be durable.",
